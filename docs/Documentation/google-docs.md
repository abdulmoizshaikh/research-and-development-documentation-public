font family and size of dropbox paperHow do they do it? Well, let’s start with the basic bits:

font-family: AtlasGrotesk-editor-rtl, AtlasGrotesk-editor, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, “Segoe UI”, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, “Open Sans”, “Helvetica Neue”, sans-serif;
font-size: 16px;
line-height: 26px;
color: #1b2733;font family and size of dropbox paper
Atlas Grotesk is a beautiful font, and the off-black color and spacing give make it feel airy and a little less serious.

What surprises me most are the little tweaks, like this one:

font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;
```
