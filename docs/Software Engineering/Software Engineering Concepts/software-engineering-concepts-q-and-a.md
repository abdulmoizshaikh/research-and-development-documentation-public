**Source map for better error logs**

A source map provides the browser with a means of mapping back code within a compressed file back to its original position in a source file. This way, when an error occurs, you’re pointed to the exact file and line from which it emanates from. So if you’re using any tool that minifies, concatenates, or bundles up your code, you’ll definitely need to generate source maps.
