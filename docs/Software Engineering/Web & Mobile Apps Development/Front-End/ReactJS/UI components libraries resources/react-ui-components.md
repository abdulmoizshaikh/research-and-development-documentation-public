# React UI Components

Tip: `Share reusable components between projects using` [Bit](https://bit.dev/) (Github).

Bit makes it simple to share, document, and organize independent components from any project.

Use it to maximize code reuse, collaborate on independent components, and build apps that scale.

Bit supports Node, TypeScript, React, Vue, Angular, and More

**What is Bit?**

Bit is an open-source cli tool for collaborating on isolated components across projects and repositories.

Use Bit to distribute discrete components from a design library or a project into a standalone reusable package and utilize it across applications.

You can set up your own server for components collaboration, or use the bit.dev cloud hosting for private and public components sharing.
