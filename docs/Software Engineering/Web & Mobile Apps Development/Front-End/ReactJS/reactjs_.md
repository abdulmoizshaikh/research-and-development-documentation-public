### ContextAPI ReactJS

**How to optimize your context value**

https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-context-value

### ADVANCED GUIDES

Bundling
Most React apps will have their files ‚Äúbundled‚Äù using tools like Webpack, Rollup or Browserify. Bundling is the process of following imported files and merging them into a single file: a ‚Äúbundle‚Äù. This bundle can then be included on a webpage to load an entire app at once.

Example
App:

```jsx showLineNumbers
// app.js
import { add } from "./math.js";

console.log(add(16, 26)); // 42

// math.js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Bundle:

```jsx showLineNumbers
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(16, 26)); // 42
```

If you‚Äôre using Create React App, Next.js, Gatsby, or a similar tool, you will have a Webpack setup out of the box to bundle your app.

**Gatsbyjs**

The static dynamic site generator for dynamic web developers

Gatsby provides development teams an open source frontend framework for creating dynamic, optimized websites and a cloud platform for delivering them on a blazing fast edge network.

**Code Splitting**

Code-splitting your app can help you ‚Äúlazy-load‚Äù just the things that are currently needed by the user, which can dramatically improve the performance of your app. While you haven‚Äôt reduced the overall amount of code in your app, you‚Äôve avoided loading code that the user may never need, and reduced the amount of code needed during the initial load.

**React.lazy**

The React.lazy function lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component.

Before:

```jsx showLineNumbers
import OtherComponent from "./OtherComponent";
```

After:

```jsx showLineNumbers
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./OtherComponent"));
```

This will automatically load the bundle containing the OtherComponent when this component is first rendered.

**Error boundaries :**

If the other module fails to load (for example, due to network failure), it will trigger an error. You can handle these errors to show a nice user experience and manage recovery with Error Boundaries. Once you‚Äôve created your Error Boundary, you can use it anywhere above your lazy components to display an error state when there‚Äôs a network error.

```jsx showLineNumbers
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import MyErrorBoundary from "./MyErrorBoundary";

const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./OtherComponent"));
const AnotherComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./AnotherComponent"));

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <MyErrorBoundary>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <section>
          <OtherComponent />
          <AnotherComponent />
        </section>
      </Suspense>
    </MyErrorBoundary>
  </div>
);
```

**Route-based code splitting**

Deciding where in your app to introduce code splitting can be a bit tricky. You want to make sure you choose places that will split bundles evenly, but won‚Äôt disrupt the user experience.

Here‚Äôs an example of how to setup route-based code splitting into your app using libraries like React Router with React.lazy.

```jsx showLineNumbers
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

const Home = lazy(() => import("./routes/Home"));
const About = lazy(() => import("./routes/About"));

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Switch>
    </Suspense>
  </Router>
);
```

**Render Props**

The term ‚Äúrender prop‚Äù refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.

A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

```jsx showLineNumbers
<DataProvider render={(data) => <h1>Hello {data.target}</h1>} />
```

Libraries that use render props include React Router, Downshift and Formik.

**Use Render Props for Cross-Cutting Concerns**

Components are the primary unit of code reuse in React, but it‚Äôs not always obvious how to share the state or behavior that one component encapsulates to other components that need that same state.

For example, the following component tracks the mouse position in a web app:

```jsx showLineNumbers
class MouseTracker extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleMouseMove = this.handleMouseMove.bind(this);
    this.state = { x: 0, y: 0 };
  }

  handleMouseMove(event) {
    this.setState({
      x: event.clientX,
      y: event.clientY,
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{ height: "100vh" }} onMouseMove={this.handleMouseMove}>
        <h1>Move the mouse around!</h1>
        <p>
          The current mouse position is ({this.state.x}, {this.state.y})
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

**More concretely, a render prop is a function prop that a component uses to know what to render.**

**Static Type Checking :**

Static type checkers like Flow and TypeScript identify certain types of problems before you even run your code. They can also improve developer workflow by adding features like auto-completion. For this reason, we recommend using Flow or TypeScript instead of PropTypes for larger code bases.

**Refs and the DOM**
Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.

**const Context = React.createContext();**

The React.createContext creates a Context object. What happens here is when React is rendering a component that subscribes to this object, it will read the context value currently in the closest matching Provider just above it. You can also provide a default value here as ‚Äòen‚Äô but it‚Äôs not necessary as we are using a language navigator.

StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. Like Fragment, StrictMode does not render any visible UI. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants

What are compound components in react ?

Enclose the state and behaviour for a group of components but still givest the rendering control for its variable parts back to the external user.
e.g think of something like the `<select>` and `<option>` element in html.

**ReactJS server-side rendering vs client-side rendering**

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27290354/reactjs-server-side-rendering-vs-client-side-rendering

### Server side rending in React

what is the content type in server side rendering

Server-side rendering (SSR) is an application's ability to convert HTML files on the server into a fully rendered HTML page for the client. The web browser submits a request for information from the server, which instantly responds by sending a fully rendered page to the client.

**Server-Side Rendering Definition**

**What is Server-Side Rendering?**

Server-side rendering (SSR) is an application‚Äôs ability to convert HTML files on the server into a fully rendered HTML page for the client. The web browser submits a request for information from the server, which instantly responds by sending a fully rendered page to the client. Search engines can crawl and index content prior to delivery, which is beneficial for Search Engine Optimization purposes.

‚Äç

Popular examples of server-side rendering JavaScript frameworks include: Angular server side rendering, ejs server side rendering, server side rendering Express, Gatsby server side rendering, Google server side rendering, NestJS server side rendering, Next server side rendering, Nuxt server side rendering, React server side rendering, and Vue server side rendering.

**What are the Benefits of Server-Side Rendering?**

Some server-side rendering advantages include:

- A server-side rendered application enables pages to load faster, improving the user experience.
- When rendering server-side, search engines can easily index and crawl content because the content can be rendered before the page is loaded, which is ideal for SEO.
- Webpages are correctly indexed because web browsers prioritize web pages with faster load times.
- Rendering server-side helps efficiently load webpages for users with slow internet connection or outdated devices.

**What are the Risks of Server-Side Rendering?**

Server-side rendering disadvantages may include:

- Rendering server-side can be costly and resource-intensive as it is not the default for JavaScript websites, and the server takes on the full burden of rendering content for users and bots.
- While rendering static HTML server-side is efficient, rendering bigger, more complex applications server-side can increase load times due to the bottleneck.
- Server-side rendering may not be compatible with third-party JavaScript code.
- Rendering server-side may be ideal for static site generation, but frequent server requests and full page reloads can result in overall slower page rendering in more complex applications.

**Server-Side Rendering vs Client-Side Rendering**

In client-server rendering, rather than receiving all of the content from the HTML document, content is rendered in the browser using the client-side JavaScript library. The browser does not make a new request to the server when a new page is loaded. Search engine rankings may be negatively impacted as the content is not rendered until the page is loaded on the browser, however, website rendering tends to be faster in client-side rendered app. In considering server side vs client side rendering, the developer will assess factors such as the scale of the project, the complexity of the application, the number of users, and user experience priorities.

**Invalid PDF Exception ! #527**

invalid pdf structure react-pdf-viewer
solution:

Invalid PDF structure

React PDF viewer

```
so I tried importing them as module and it loaded the pdf !!!

import myPdf from ''.../assets/pdfs/myDoc.pdf
and then storing it in a var and passing that var to Document
const pdf = myPdf
<Document file={pdf}>
<Page pageNum...></Page>

BUT then it will have so many imports in the component one for each pdf and the application I am working on can have more pdfs added to them later on and path is stored in JSON related to the current directory structure

so may be I will look into if I can do dynamic imports based on props -- that's the route I am looking to and asking for if you know any solution for that cause again as I said don't want imports for each and every pdf

Thanks
```
